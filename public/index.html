    <strong>  What is steroid induced diabetes?</strong>
    <p>Sometimes patients with interstitial lung diseases are prescribed steroids as a way to control the inflammation in their lungs. The drugs in this category carry some side effects that you may be familiar with – increased appetite, weight gain, high
      blood pressure and fluid retention – but there is one side effect that you may not be familiar with. It’s possible after taking steroids over a course of days or weeks to develop what’s called steroid induced diabetes.</p>

    <p>Steroids oppose the action of insulin – a hormone produced in the liver that helps to regulate sugar in the blood. The result of this is that individuals on steroids may experience prolonged elevation in their blood sugar – or fasting glucose – that
      brings about diabetic conditions.</p>

          <h4 class="card-title">Is steroid induced diabetes permanent?</h4>
          <p class="card-text">It can be, but most of the time it’s a temporary condition. Usually when the patient is taken off of the steroids that induced the diabetes, the diabetes will subside.</p>

          <h4 class="card-title">How is steroid induced diabetes diagnosed?</h4>
          <p class="card-text">The criteria for diagnosis of steroid induced diabetes is the same for those of diabetes, but while they are on glucocorticoid therapy. If the patient has a fasting glucose persistently above 125 mg/dL or sample levels above 200 mg/dL, they
            may be diagnosed with this condition. <br>It’s important to distinguish this type of diabetes from other types so that it may be treated properly. It’s often the case that a patient who was borderline diabetic before they began glucocorticoid
            therapy that the drugs may put them over the edge into diabetic territory. </p>

          <h4 class="card-title">How can steroid induced diabetes be treated?</h4>
          <p class="card-text">Treatment is dependent upon how long the patient will be on the steroids and the extent to which the blood sugar is elevated. If the blood sugar levels are mildly high and the steroid treatment brief, the patient may not require treatment at
            all. If the levels are moderate or if the treatment will continue for longer, the patient with elevated blood sugar may be more susceptible to infections, and the physician may prescribe insulin until the condition subsides. </p>
